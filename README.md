This the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for answering technical questions related to FAA aircraft inspection, damage tolerance, fatigue evaluation, and structural maintenance documents.  Unlike generic LLM responses, this system strictly answers questions only from the provided FAA documentation.
